# Psychedelic-Conic-Composites
A simple visualization tool that creates psychedelic prints from composite plots of circles and hyberbolae over multiple finite fields. Inspired in part by [Modular Hyberbolas](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.2879.pdf) by Igor E. Shparlinski. The [gif](https://github.com/vitthalyp/Psychedelic-Conic-Composites/blob/master/modular_hyperbola.gif) diplays a time lapse of these composites starting from the first odd prime to the 42nd prime. The [mp4 file](https://github.com/vitthalyp/Psychedelic-Conic-Composites/blob/master/modular_hyperbola.mp4) is the same time lapse with Tame Impala's [Feels like we only go backwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8_EpxhNEsA) as its soundtrack.

The [Faster plot](https://github.com/vitthalyp/Psychedelic-Conic-Composites/blob/master/Faster_Plots.ipynb) notebook hastens computation by factoring the hyperbolic equation into (x-y)(x+y) and then finding inverses as a counter runs through non-zero elements. Using this, the [faster_hyperbola gif](https://github.com/vitthalyp/Psychedelic-Conic-Composites/blob/master/faster_hyperbola.gif) examines the hyperbola in large prime fields. In this instance, we begin with primes from the 1900th prime, 16411, to the 2020th prime, 17579.

# Psychedelic-Conic-Composites
A simple visualization tool that creates psychedelic prints from composite plots of circles and hyberbolae over multiple finite fields. Inspired in part by [Modular Hyberbolas](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.2879.pdf) by Igor E. Shparlinski. The gif diplays a time lapse of these composites starting from a single prime to the first 42 primes. The mp4 file is the same time lapse with Tame Impala's [Feels like we only go backwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8_EpxhNEsA) as its soundtrack.
